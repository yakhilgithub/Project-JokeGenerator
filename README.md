# Day 7 of 30 days 30 projects challenege
This project is a simple web application that brings joy and laughter to users by generating random jokes with just a click of a button. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and visually appealing experience.

# HTML
The HTML file (JG.html) provides the structure and content of the web page. It includes elements such as the title, buttons, and joke display area.
# CSS
The CSS file (JG.css) is responsible for the visual styling of the web page. It defines the layout, colors, fonts, and animations to create an attractive and modern design.
# JavaScript
The JavaScript file (JG.js) adds interactivity to the web page. It fetches random jokes from an API, handles user interactions, and dynamically updates the joke display area.
How to Use
1. Simply open the JG.html file in a web browser.
2. Click the "Make me happy" button to generate a random joke and bring a smile to your face.
